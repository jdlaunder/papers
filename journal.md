# Introduction
Haywood et al. (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara.
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al., 2000).

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model.
It reproduces the growth in size distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method of growth.

# Methodology
We used an AMS (Allan et al., 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical composition.
