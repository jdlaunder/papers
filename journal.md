# Abstract
We write this last because it's difficult to do.
This is where we summarise our results so lazy people don't have to read the whole thing but can still reference it.

# Introduction
Haywood et al. (1999) made some great measurements of BBOA over the Sahara.
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol mass spectrometer (Allen et al., 2000).

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model.
It reproduces the growth in size distribution observed and suggests coagulation as the dominant method of growth.

# Methodology
We used an AMS (Allan et al., 1999) to measure particle mass and chemical composition.

# Results
We observed particle growth through coagulation, and report the changing chemical composition with age in the atmosphere.

# Figures
Here are some cool figures.

# Conclusions
We made some groundbreaking discovery, aren't we great?! There's more to do, give us more funding!

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the EU funding body for their support. RIP :( (?)
